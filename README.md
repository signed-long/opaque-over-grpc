### What is OPAQUE?
The OPAQUE protocol is a password authenticated key exchange, designed to securely establish a shared secret key between two parties over an insecure network, such as the internet. The protocol allows for authetication to a server without your password ever leaving your device, while being robust to offline pre-computation attacks.

### Why gRPC?
Traditional registration and authentication flows take only 1 round trip between the client and the server. You send your password in plaintext and the server either stores or verifies it, usually using some salted hash function. OPAQUE on the other hand takes 2 round trips. This not only increases the overhead for completing the flow in terms of latency, serialization / deserialization cost etc, but also requires a session / some state stored on the server. In modern containerized applications it is recommended to have stateless apps to simplify the operational burden of scaling, deployment, and fault tolerance. By using gRPC as the communication protocol we can skirt some of the shortcoming of a 2 round trip flow. The gRPC protocol uses binary messages, and HTTP/2 which decrease the cost of additional round trips. GRPC streams also create a sort of sticky session with the server, so that in stateless deployments the client's messages don't end up being sent to the wrong backend instance mid flow.

<!-- ### Running the demo
1. Start client and server containers using docker compose: 
```
docker compose up --build
```
2. Get a shell in the client container
```
exec
```
3. Register / login with the cli application
```
``` -->
### Drawbacks
While this project was a fun exercise in implementing a new authentication protocol, there are a few critical drawbacks to using this in applications today. 

Both gRPC, and the golang implementation of OPAQUE used significantly reduces the types of clients supported. This implementation requires a golang client and server to be using the gopaque library. Also the gRPC stream used is not supported with clients running in the web browser due to the [limitations of gRPC-web](https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web/).


A more viable solution (and production ready) to the problems addressed by OPAQUE here is [Passkeys](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/so-long-passwords-thanks-for-all-phish.html).
